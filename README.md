# Homework 1 - Personal Website

## Create a Personal Website for yourself, including and About Me page and Resume.

Create your index.html and about.html files. Then write plain text for the content and mark it up. Utilize all of the tags we've learned this week. `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`

Then add CSS styles, an image, and link the two pages together.

Use Wendy Biteâ€™s website as a guide, but feel free to branch-out or get creative as your current skills allow.
